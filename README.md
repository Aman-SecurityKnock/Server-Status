# Server-Status:
An Apache server-status monitoring script exploits publicly accessible instances of Apache server-status to monitor and extract URL requests and clients connected to the service.


# Apache Server-Status:
http://example.com/server-status is the default website for Apache server-status monitoring. Server-status instances are normally inaccessible to IP addresses outside the local network. However, if misconfigured, the server-status page may be publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view a significant amount of server status data.

One crucial piece of information that can be valuable to long-term attackers and red-teamers is the ability to see clients' IP addresses and the URLs they are requesting on an Apache server. This information is readily available through the Apache server-status page, which provides real-time updates on server activity. If this page is exposed to the public, it can pose a significant security risk as it allows unauthorized individuals to monitor and potentially exploit sensitive data.

# What types of data can be compromised?

- Monitor all requested URLs by all Hosts/VHosts on the Apache server, including hidden and obscure files and directories.
- Track session tokens passed through GET REQUEST_URI, such as https://example.com/?token=123, as they can be exposed even with SSL encryption.
- Log the IP addresses of all clients along with the URLs they have requested.
